# Code Coverage

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/occlum/occlum/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=FS22ULGGRC)](https://codecov.io/gh/occlum/occlum)

Occlum is written in several different programming languages(i.e., Rust, C and Assembly), and Rust is the major part, so we have only collected the code coverage for Rust so far. The code coverage data is collected through the `make test` and `make test-glibc` commands, it can be improved if we add more tests.
