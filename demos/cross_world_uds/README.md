# Cross World Unix Domain Socket Demo

This demo shows the capability that unix domain socket running in Occlum can communicate with:
* A unix domain socket created in the same Occlum instance
* A unix domain socket created in the host OS
* A unix domain socket created in another Occlum instance

To run this demo, just run:
` ./run_cross_world_uds_test.sh `
