//! SchedAgent manages the CPU scheduler settings for a thread.
//!
//! # Scheduler Settings
//!
//! Currently, the only scheduler setting that SchedAgent can access and update
//! is the CPU affinity of a thread. Other settings will be added in the future.
//!
//! # The Two Modes: Attached vs Detached
//!
//! SchedAgent works in one of the two modes: the attached mode and the detached
//! mode.
//!
//! When a SchedAgent is created, it is initially in the detached mode,
//! meaning that the SchedAgent is not attached to any host OS thread. Thus,
//! any call on SchedAgent to update scheduler settings does not actually affect any
//! host OS thread; SchedAgent just records the updates.
//!
//! After SchedAgent becomes attached to some host OS thread by invoking the `attach`
//! method, all previous updates recorded during in the detached mode will
//! be applied to the host OS thread. Afterwards, all setting updates will be applied
//! immediately to the host OS thread---until SchedAgent is detached from the
//! host OS thread.
