/// Task Interrupt ReQuests (TIRQs).
///
/// # Motivation
///
/// In the `async_rt` crate, our primary means to put a task to sleep until some
/// interesting events happen are `Waiter`, in particular, the
/// `Waiter::wait`-family method. But what if some more urgent events
/// happen that need the task immediate attention? For example,
/// a kill signal. To kill a task gracefully, we want a task
/// that is blocking on a waiter to stop waiting. For this reason, we must
/// be able to _interrupt_.
///
/// # Overview
///
/// Task Interrupt ReQuests (TIRQs) is a mechanism to interrupt tasks.
/// In a sense, TIRQs to a task is like hardware IRQs to a x86 CPU core.
/// Each task is given 64 interrupt lines. An interrupt line has a boolean status:
/// set or clear. Initially, an interrupt line is clear. If we put a TIRQ on the line
/// then the status of the line becomes set. We can put TIRQs on a line
/// multiple times, but the status of the line remains set.
/// After handling the event represented by the interrupt line (and its TIRQs),
/// a handler can clear the line.
///
/// Putting a TIRQ on an interrupt line of a task _interrupts_ the task. By interrupt,
/// we mean that the following two consequencies for any waiter executed in the
/// context of the task:
///
/// 1. If the waiter has been waiting, then the waiter will stop waiting. (The
/// return value of the wait is most likely be `Err(EINTR)`. But it could also
/// be `Ok(())` or `Err(ETIMEDOUT)`.)
/// 2. If the waiter attempts to wait, then the waiter immediately returns with
/// `Err(EINTR)`.
///
/// Either way, the task can now proceed, having a chance to deal with the
/// urgent matters that trigger the TIRQ. And after handling the urgent
/// matters, the user code should clear the corresponding TIRQs properly.
///
/// There could be many reasons to interrupt depending the specific use case.
/// The user code decides which
/// interrupt line means which kind of reason. Similar to hardware IRQs,
/// we may want to disable certain IRQs in certain circumstances. Thus,
/// we also associate a task with a TIRQ mask. A TIRQ put on a masked
/// interrupt line is called _pending_: it won't interrupt the task until
/// the line is unmasked. And when the line is unmasked, the TIRQ becomes _active_.
///
/// # Example: kill a task gracefully
///
/// Consider the following async function.
///
/// ```no_run
/// use async_rt::wait::Waiter;
/// use errno::prelude::*;
///
/// async fn blocked_code() {
///     let waiter = Waiter::new();
///     let res = waiter.wait().await;
///     match res {
///         Err(e) => {
///             assert!(e.errno() == EINTR);
///         }
///         _ => {
///             panic!("impossible as there is no waker or timeout");
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// As no one is going to wake up the waiter and the wait method does not
/// take a timeout, a task that executes the function will blocked forever,
/// having no chance to run to complete.
///
/// With TIRQs, such tasks can be interrupted.
///
/// ```no_run
/// # async fn blocked_code() {}
/// # async_rt::task::block_on(async {
/// // Spawn a task that will not exit---unless receiving TIRQs
/// let handle = async_rt::task::spawn(async {
///     blocked_code().await;
/// });
///
/// // Put a TIRQ on the task, causing the task to exit
/// handle.task().tirqs().put_req(0 /* use TIRQ line #0 */);
///
/// // Wait for the task to exit
/// handle.await;
/// # });
/// ```
///
/// # Limitations
///
/// Currently, TIRQs can only interrupt tasks that are blocked on waiters.
/// A manually-written future is not interruptible by TIRQs unless the
/// future is written to respect TIRQs (as the waiters do).
/// This may be considered a limitation or a feature depending on your perspective.
